### Legend

  - **Name**: Variable name
  - **type**: Data type of the variable
  - **missing**: Proportion of missing values for this variable
  - **unique**: Number of unique values
  - **mean**: Mean value
  - **median**: Median value
  - **mode**: Most common value (for categorical variables, this shows
    the frequency of the most common category)
  - **mode\_value**: For categorical variables, the value of the most
    common category
  - **sd**: Standard deviation (measure of dispersion for numerical
    variables
  - **v**: Agresti’s V (measure of dispersion for categorical variables)
  - **min**: Minimum value
  - **max**: Maximum value
  - **range**: Range between minimum and maximum value
  - **skew**: Skewness of the variable
  - **skew\_2se**: Skewness of the variable divided by 2\*SE of the
    skewness. If this is greater than abs(1), skewness is significant
  - **kurt**: Kurtosis (peakedness) of the variable
  - **kurt\_2se**: Kurtosis of the variable divided by 2\*SE of the
    kurtosis. If this is greater than abs(1), kurtosis is significant.
